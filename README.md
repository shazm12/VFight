The Cyber Crime Management System can be proven to be very effective for the Cyber Expoerts in the organization also for the police forces in the Cyber Cell to maintain and update cyber crime cases and records and also can be used by victims to report their cases immediately so the Cyber Experts and the police of the Cyber Cells can start working on it immediately. In this project,we have implemented a cyber crime management system where an employee from a cybersecurity company can have a record of entities like hacked websites,accounts and such and keep updating like how was the entity attacked,the victimâ€™s details and whether the problem was fixed or not.This can be proven to be very effective way for cyber experts to keep track and record of their work and maintain them time to time. This can be used by organizations to keep record of their cases and also be informed of any cyber crime immediately and start working on it as soon as possible.
