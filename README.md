The Cyber Crime Management System can be proven to be very effective for the Cyber Experts in the organization also for the police forces in the Cyber Cell to maintain and update cyber crime cases and records and also can be used by victims to report their cases immediately so the Cyber Experts and the police of the Cyber Cells can start working on it immediately. In this project,we have implemented a cyber crime management system where an employee from a cybersecurity company can have a record of entities like hacked websites,accounts and such and keep updating like how was the entity attacked,the victimâ€™s details and whether the problem was fixed or not.This can be proven to be very effective way for cyber experts to keep track and record of their work and maintain them time to time. This can be used by organizations to keep record of their cases and also be informed of any cyber crime immediately and start working on it as soon as possible.


## **Installing dependencies and making the app ready to use or work on your device**

1.Since we are using EJS here,make sure to let know server that you are using EJS here by writing the following code-
```
app.use( express.static('public'));
//set EJS as templating engine
app.set("view engine","ejs");

```
2. Make a views folder to write all your EJS files and to use CSS and JS files and even assets like imgs,vids and such make a folder named public and put your CSS,JS and assets files in there.
 
3. Since I am using MySQL as my server, you can use any RDBMS or Non-RDBMS database and connect it with your server from the respective docs ,also make the required tables for it mentioned in tables text file.

4. Use npm update or npm install to install all dependencies.

5. Now your web app will be ready to use,run it using npm start.



Thanks for looking into my project!ðŸ˜Ž
